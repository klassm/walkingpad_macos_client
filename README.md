#  Deskfit MacOS Client

A native MacOS Client (as status bar app) to watch your steps.

### Installation

Download the latest release from the [releases section](https://github.com/klassm/deskfit-macos-client/releases).

### Features

* Connect to your treadmill via Bluetooth
* Watch your steps, the app will accumulate the steps
* You can change the speed directly in the app
* GoogleFit support - connect the app to your Google Fit account. Whenever you pause or stop the treadmill, the steps will be uploaded to Google Fit.

#### Alfred Support

As the app stays connected to your treadmill, it is kind of convenient to also control the treadmill via Alfred and this app. This is much faster than [Alfred DFT200](https://github.com/klassm/alfred-dft200), as the bluetooth connection does not have to be re-established.
